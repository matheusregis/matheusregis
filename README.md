### Welcome! 😁

My name is Matheus Régis, I'm 26 years old, and I'm from Fraiburgo, Santa Catarina (🇧🇷).
I love technology, since I was little, always fissured by the power of computers, and games.
I grew up and became interested in the IT area, mainly the Hardware area, so I decided that after high school, I would study Computer Science.
When I got to the course and started to see that the course was basically programming, I got desperate, it wasn't what I wanted, and I started to get discouraged.
It was then that I learned about Web Programming, and I confess it was love at first sight. <br>
I have much to thank [![Alura Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Alura-blue)](https://www.alura.com.br), 
[![Rocketseat Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rockeseat-purple)](https://rocketseat.com.br/) <br>
It was thanks to these companies that I learned to like programming. <br>

In my spare time, I like to watch a series, play games with friends, and sit, talk and drink a beer with friends or family.

Thanks for reading about me and follow on social media!
